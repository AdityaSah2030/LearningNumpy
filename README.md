## 📚 Notebook Details  

### 1️⃣ `phase-1.ipynb` - Introduction to NumPy  
This notebook covers the foundational concepts of NumPy, including:  
✅ Installing and importing NumPy  
✅ Creating arrays (`np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.arange()`)  
✅ Basic array operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)  
✅ Indexing, slicing, and iterating through arrays  

---

### 2️⃣ `phase-2.ipynb` - Intermediate NumPy Operations  
Builds upon the basics and introduces more advanced concepts:  
✅ Understanding NumPy data types (`dtype`)  
✅ Reshaping arrays (`reshape()`, `flatten()`, `transpose()`)  
✅ Stacking and splitting arrays (`vstack()`, `hstack()`, `split()`)  
✅ Broadcasting and its applications in mathematical operations  

---

### 3️⃣ `phase-3.ipynb` - Advanced NumPy Concepts  
Delves deeper into advanced topics:  
✅ Universal functions (ufuncs) for element-wise operations  
✅ Statistical operations (`mean()`, `std()`, `var()`)  
✅ Generating random numbers using `numpy.random`  
✅ Boolean indexing and filtering data  

---

### 4️⃣ `phase-4.ipynb` - Practical Applications of NumPy  
Applies NumPy concepts to real-world scenarios, including:  
✅ Image processing basics using NumPy  
✅ Data manipulation for machine learning (normalization, standardization)  
✅ Solving linear algebra problems with `numpy.linalg`  
✅ Performance optimization and memory efficiency techniques
